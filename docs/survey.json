I’m very concerned about surveillance technologies because I see it as yet another policing method that will exacerbate the school to prison pipeline. We know already that license plate recognition is used disproportionately in low income communities of color. I’d bet money that’s true of CCTV and Shotspotter too, and that social media tracking is being used to primarily target people of color. Having these technologies in our neighborhoods will mean having more police officers, which will mean more arrests. My students don’t need to be arrested, they need to be in school, learning."
